            <div class="panel-body" style="background-color:lightgreen">
                <p>Question: How do you define an AngularJS application?</p>
                <P>Answer: An Angular module defines the application, which is a container for different parts like controllers, factorys, services. The ng-app directive is used to specify the name of the application module and is required for all Angularjs applications.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is a controller?</p>
                <P>Answer: Angularjs controller/s control the data of Angularjs applications and are defined using the ng-controller directive in both html and in .js file/s.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What does ng-model do?</p>
                <P>Answer: Built in directive, binds an input, select, textarea to a property on the scope using NgModelController, which is created and exposed by this directive. ngModel is responsible for: Binding the view into the model. The model is the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts. </P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is interpolation markup?</p>
                <P>Answer: Interpolation markup with embedded expressions is used by Angular to provide data-binding to text nodes and attribute values. Example: ng-href="img/{{username}}.jpg">Hello {{username}}
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is $scope?</p>
                <P>Answer: Scope is a special javascript object which helps join a controller with views. The scope contains the model data. Within the controller this model data can be accessed using the $scope obj</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is dependency injection?</p>
                <P>Answer: Built in mechanism that can be used with the following components:
                	Service, factory, provider, constant, value. Each of these components can be injected into each other as dependencies.       		
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is two-way binding?</p>
                <P>Answer: Data binding synchonizes data between between the model and the view.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is 'controller as' syntax?</p>
                <P>Answer: Eliminates $scope as a dependency. This cleans up our controller a bit.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is MV* architecture?</p>
                <P>Answer: Part of Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software design pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. The model represents the data, and does nothing else. The model does NOT depend on the controller or the view.
The view displays the model data, and sends user actions (e.g. button clicks) to the controller. The view can:
be independent of both the model and the controller; or
actually be the controller, and therefore depend on the model. This architecture has become popular for designing web applications.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Question: What is the difference between a service and a factory?</p>
                <P>Answer: A service is a constructor function, however, that doesn’t prevent us from doing additional work and return object literals. A Factory returns an object, says we can run code before we return our object literal.</P>
